# WNL Calc 2025
Wife N' Life Returns. By Myself and Patrick Steadman!

## Updates

- Stress factors (how well you can handle stress)
- Based on a 1-100% scale
- If over 30%, you should feel confident

## Usage

Just like in [WNL Calc 2021](https://github.com/Montana/wnl-calc-2021), just run the following:

```bash
chmod +x wnl2025.py
python3 wnl2025.py

Then answer the questions and get your WNL %!
